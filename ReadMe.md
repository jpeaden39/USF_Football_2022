The reason I created this project was to start to use SQL hands on, while also being able to analyze one of my favorite football teams throughout the 2022 season. I am an Alumn from USF and I thought this would be a great first project to create while continuing to learn in MySQL. This project is compiled of all the offensive stats and offensive stats of usf's opponets. My goal of this project was to become more familiar with relational databases, however due to the less than spectacular performance of the usf football team it was difficult to make assumptions from the data on a weekly basis due to inconsistency. 
The DLL file is where I created all three of tables I used (schedule, offensive stats, defensive stats).
